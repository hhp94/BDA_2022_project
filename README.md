Research question: Model the association between depression, history of sexual abuse, and social intervention, longitudinally.\
Outcome: EPDS score, a measure of depression\
Exposure: 1) History of sexual abuse (mixture of 5 variables) and 2) social intervention (1 single score)\
Model: Hierarchical Ordinal Regression\
The challenges below are difficult. Because of the time limit, we might only complete the first challenge:\
  Challenge 1: Model the EPDS score outcome ordinally. We need to use the cumulative link function with the intercepts as a linear combination of the exposures.\
  Challenge 2: Social intervention is an ordinal score. History of sexual abuse should be modeled as a mixture of 5 variables.\
  Challenge 3: The data is longitudinal with 4 time points. How do you partial pool information if you model social intervention as an ordered categorical predictor and sexual abuse as a mixture of variables?\
  Challenge 4: How do you correctly validate the model?\
